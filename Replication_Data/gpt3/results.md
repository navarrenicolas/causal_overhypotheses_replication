A blicket detector is a special kind of machine, objects that are different colors and shapes either make the machine turn on or not. If the object is a blicket and placed on the machine then the machine will turn on. Sometimes 1, 2 or 3 blickets make the machine turn on. Our goal is to make the machine turn on and figure out which shapes make it do so. 

First I have a striped pattern blicket detector, it behaves in the following way: I have 3 objects, one blue pyramid, one green cube and one orange sphere. First I put the blue pyramid on the striped pattern blicket machine and it does not light up. Then I put the orange sphere on the striped pattern blicket machine and it does not light up. Then I put the blue pyramid and the orange sphere on the striped pattern blicket machine and it did light up! Then I have a dotted pattern blicket detector. I have 3 different objects now, a yellow cylinder, a purple cone, and a red dome. First I put the purple cone on the dotted pattern blicket detector and it did light up! Then I put the yellow cylinder on the dotted pattern blicket detector and it does not light up. Then I put the yellow cylinder and the purple cone on the dotted pattern blicket detector and it did light up!Then I have a checkerboard pattern blicket detector. I have 3 new objects, a teal prism, a pink frustum and a brown torus. This machine could work like the dotted patterned blicket detector or it could work like the striped pattern blicket detector. First I put the brown torus on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it does light up! Then I put the pink frustum on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it does not light up. Then I put the teal prism on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it does not light up. Then I put the brown torus and the pink frustum on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it did light up! Then I put the teal prism and the brown torus on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it did light up! Then I put the teal prism and the pink frustum and the brown torus on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it did light up! Then I put the pink frustum and the teal prism on the checkerboard pattern blicket detector and it does not light up.Can you tell me which objects are blickets? Does this checkerboard pattern blicket detector behave like the striped pattern blicket detector or like the dotted pattern blicket detector? 


GPT3: The blickets are the blue pyramid, the orange sphere, the purple cone, the yellow cylinder, the brown torus, the pink frustum and the teal prism. The checkerboard pattern blicket detector behaves like the striped pattern blicket detector.
